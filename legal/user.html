It is the user's sole responsibility to ensure that they have backed up any files they wish to save externally before proceeding with the installation. The installer will not be held responsible for any data loss that may occur as a result of the data wiping process.</p>
        <h4>4. System Performance:</h4>
        <p>Installer aims to improve system performance through custom configurations. However, individual results may vary depending on hardware specifications and system usage. Specific performance outcomes are not guaranteed.</p>
        <h4>5. Internet Access and Parental Protection:</h4>
