        <h4>3.  System Compatibility Assessment:</h4>

        <h4>4.  Payment and Travel Fees:</h4>
        <p>Full payment, including service charges, is required in advance. If the client chooses the option to have their system picked up by Alter, a 60¢ per mile travel fee for the round trip will be applied based on the distance determined during the pre-appointment assessment and confirmation. If the client chooses the option to drop off their system at Alter's designated location, no additional travel fee will be charged. Full refunds are issued for cancellations with at least 48 hours’ notice. Refunds for late cancellations are at Alter’s discretion.</p>
        <h4>5.  Trade-in Policy:</h4>
        <p>Clients may trade in their system for a pre-determined Alter system. This is final upon acceptance, with no returns. Trade-ins must include all original assessed components, and Alter reserves the right to refuse trade-ins not meeting conditions.</p>
        <h4>6.  Appointment Planning:</h4>

        <h4>Dispute Resolution Process:</h4>
        <h5>1.  Mediation:</h5>
        <p>In the event of a dispute, both Alter and the client agree to first attempt to resolve the issue through mediation. A neutral third-party mediator will be selected by mutual agreement. Each party will bear their own costs in mediation, and the mediation process will be confidential.</p>
        <h5>2.	Arbitration:</h5>
        <p>If mediation does not successfully resolve the dispute, the matter will be submitted to binding arbitration. The arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the rules of a recognized arbitration association, as agreed upon by both parties. The decision of the arbitrator will be final and binding on both parties.</p>
        <h5>3.	Litigation:</h5>
        <p>Only if mediation and arbitration do not resolve the dispute, may either party seek legal recourse through the courts. Any litigation will be subject to the jurisdiction of Boise, Idaho, or applicable federal law.</p>
        <h5>4.	Costs and Fees:</h5>
        <p>The costs of mediation and arbitration will be shared equally between Alter and the client, unless the mediator or arbitrator decides otherwise based on the circumstances of the dispute.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Governing Law:</h4>
